<p>ATP应当尽可能向ZC发送位置报告，即上电后一旦与LC初始化成功，并且获取到所管辖当前线路的ZC的编号时，就与该ZC进行通信。当列车车身跨2个ZC时，ATP应当同时向这2个ZC发送位置报告。位置报告中包括列车的识别信息，ATP工作状态，以及列车定位情况等，供ZC计算本列车的AP范围、属性以及EOA。
ATP shall send the Location Report to ZC as far as possible. After ATP powered up and the communication with LC had fulfilled, and get the current ZC id, it shall communicate with ZC. When the train passes across two ZC, ATP should also send the Location Report to both ZC. The information of Location Report includes train recognition information, ATP status, and train location, so that ZC can calculate the AP scope, properties and EOA of the train.</p>
