对于已定位状态的列车，ATP需要根据车头或车尾所在的位置，处理线路上与列车位置有关奇点。例如判断列车是否在车站开门授权区域内，是否与PSD区域有交集，或者是否越过了限制状态的信号机等。
For the localized train, ATP shall consider the singularities within the range of train locations from the head END to the tail. For instance, ATP need to estimate whether the train is in the authorized area for opening the door in station, or whether the train location intersects with the PSD, or whether the train location exceeds the signal with restricted status.
